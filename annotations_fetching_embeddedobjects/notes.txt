		            enforce unique constraints

@Id		          Used for declaring a primary key inside our POJO class

@Column	        It is used to specify column mappings. It means if in case we don’t need the 		                   name of the column that we declare in POJO but we need to refer to that entity you                 can change the name for the database table. Some attributes are-

		            Name – We can change the name of the entity for the database
		            length – the size of the column mostly used in strings
		            unique – the column is marked for containing only unique values
		            nullable – The column values should not be null. It’s marked as NOT

@Transient	    Tells the hibernate, not to add this particular column

@Temporal	      This annotation is used to format the date for storing in the database
